This project takes a deep dive into the nineteenth-century U.S. postal service when it was the largest communication service at the time. It reached nearly every city in every town by the end of the century. This map helps illustrate the expansion of the postal service towards the west and its opening and closing of over 14,000 post offices. The map is interactive and clear which makes it easily accessible and engaging for researchers such as students. 

The directors of the project go into detail to address that they adopted the research of postal historian Richard Helbock from United States Post Offices and brought it to life through the use of an interactive map with various features to explain the changes in the spread and accessibility of the post offices. The scholars disclaim that there are some slight inaccuracies in the data. The first being that there are many post offices missing from the map due to the data being incomplete or not available. In order to make up for the incomplete data, they noted to the side of the map how many post offices are missing on the map for each given time period. The second disclaimer is that not every name change of each post office was recorded and it was noted as an old office closing and a new office opening even if it was the same office with a different name.The final disclaimer noted that the multiple opening and closing of the post offices were not recorded, only the final date of operation was represented.

As far as the technology used for this project goes, it felt somewhat outdated. There was yet another disclaimer at the bottom of the page that stated which browsers would work best to use the website. Even with the appropriate browser I still experienced difficulty. I enjoyed the aesthetic of the page as the colors gave it almost a “spooky” vibe from the past. The information that the directors provided about how to use the various buttons and features on the website came in handy. After reading the set of directions, I felt like I really knew how to use all of the features of the website and I could get the full experience that the directories had in mind. One of the major issues I experienced was with the major lag of the website as a whole. Even though I was using the specified browser, I felt that the technology that the directors used brought up lots of issues for the user. When clicking on various buttons or trying to interact with the map, there was a major delay and I found myself clicking on things multiple times because the actions were not being taken, then having the site load the action after a few seconds after I had clicked on a different action. Perhaps a way to solve this would be to update the codes or technology of the website in order to create a better experience for the users. Overall it is a good and informative map and provided adequate information about the topic at hand.
