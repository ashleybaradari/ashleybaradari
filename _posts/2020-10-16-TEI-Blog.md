In this blog post I will describe my first experience with TEI. TEI stands for “Text Encoding Initiative” and is a very new term for me. To complete this project, we needed to first read Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-paper” After reading the piece I was assigned the second column of page 648 of “The Yellow Wall-paper” and we began the first step to the coding process. 

One of the first steps in the project was going to the assigned Google Doc we had and we started marking up the document with comments where coding needed to go. This step was rather easy for me because it is something that I am used to doing and I am familiar with. We were told what areas of the text to make comments on so we could add code into the coding software later on. This step also made it easier to know where I had to add coding into software itself. 
  
The areas of the text that needed to be commented on were page beginnings, column beginnings, paragraphs, em dashes, any italic words, quotes, any misspelled words, illustrations, by lines, and the title. In my specific section of the reading, I only had to make comments on paragraph beginnings, the column beginning, quotes, and em-dashes. Once again, this step made it much easier to go into coding software and begin the coding process because everything was already laid out with where code needed to go.
