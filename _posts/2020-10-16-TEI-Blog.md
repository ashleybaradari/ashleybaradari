In this blog post I will describe my first experience with TEI. TEI stands for “Text Encoding Initiative” and is a very new term for me. To complete this project, we needed to first read Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-paper” After reading the piece I was assigned the second column of page 648 of “The Yellow Wall-paper” and we began the first step to the coding process. 

One of the first steps in the project was going to the assigned Google Doc we had and we started marking up the document with comments where coding needed to go. This step was rather easy for me because it is something that I am used to doing and I am familiar with. We were told what areas of the text to make comments on so we could add code into the coding software later on. This step also made it easier to know where I had to add coding into software itself. 
  
The areas of the text that needed to be commented on were page beginnings, column beginnings, paragraphs, em dashes, any italic words, quotes, any misspelled words, illustrations, by lines, and the title. In my specific section of the reading, I only had to make comments on paragraph beginnings, the column beginning, quotes, and em-dashes. Once again, this step made it much easier to go into coding software and begin the coding process because everything was already laid out with where code needed to go.

The final step of the process was to add code into the coding software. We used a software called Oxygen for this step. Oxygen itself was a very intimidating software for me. I have very little experience with coding and as soon as I opened it I was already overwhelmed. There was already some code laid out that we were instructed not to mess with. Dr. Stover did a great job of explaining the software to us and how the project was going to go step by step. This was very helpful to ease my mind about the assignment ahead. 

When it came time to actually form the project I was still nervous. Even though Dr. Stover gave a great in depth tutorial about how we should do each step, it was still very nerve wracking for me. After fully understanding the steps I realized that it was a much easier process than I thought. Most of the task was a matter of copy pasting with a few formatting add ins. I ran into only one issue when my code was not working properly, but it was just on the wrong line. Once I resolved that issue and got the hang of inserting coding, it was smooth sailing.

I actually enjoyed this project and learning a new skill. At first I was very nervous and intimidated but it turned out to be better than I expected. Oxygen was a good software to use to take the first step into the coding world and the tasks were simple enough that it was not overwhelming for a first time user like me. It was helpful  to start the process on Google Docs first so I could refer back to it frequently when putting code in. I am glad I was introduced to this project and now I am eager to learn and do more with coding in the future.
