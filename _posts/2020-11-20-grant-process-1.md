In class we have been working on our grant project. I chose to make a DH project that is a timeline of all of the Disney movies, but with a twist. My goal is to make a visually appealing interactive timeline that displays all of the movies, while also including the year they were created, a small blurb about the movie, and the grossing statistics for each movie. 

What makes my project unique from others is the way the website page will be designed. I intend to have a general timeline on the landing page, then have a menu on the side where users can organize the timeline based on genre. For example, some of the menu categories will be halloween movies, princess movies, and even Christmas movies. 

After coming up with this idea, the first thing I needed to do was research other projects. I needed to make sure there were no projects out there that did the same thing I wanted to do. After looking up countless Disney timeline projects, I found that there was nothing out there that matched exactly what I plan on creating. 

Most of the projects that I came across were basic timelines. Some were of every Disney movie but were not very interactive. Some of the projects were very outdated and not user friendly. And some projects that I found were good outlines, but only partially captured what I want to create. One project that I came across was a timeline of Disney Princess Movies. It was laid out nicely and in a way that I would like to lay out my timeline, but it lacked a sense of interactivity and excitement.

My research has been fairly steady for the most part. It was not difficult to find projects similar to mine. Disney is a rather common project topic in my opinion. I did have issues with finding scholarly sources on my topic. I was not too sure how to go about it at first but I did end up coming up with a few sources. Hopefully with more research, I can come up with more scholarly sources as well. 

I would say my project is still almost identical to my original abstract. I originally stated how I wanted to do a timeline on Disney movies and that is still the goal. The only thing I added is the idea of adding the grossing statistics for each individual movie. I believe that will give my project a unique edge and provide something that other projects have not done before.

This project has given me some bumps in the road, but overall I have enjoyed the process. When writing my grant proposal I have had some issues but I am working to solve them. I did not expect this project to be as laborious as it is but nevertheless, I know it will pay off in the end. 

The process has been very interesting and eye opening for me. This type of research is something that I have never done before. I am glad I got a chance to experience this and I feel as though I have learned a lot along the way. I am eager to learn more and continue on with the process of grant writing as the semester progresses.
