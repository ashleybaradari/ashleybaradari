My name is Ashley Baradari and I am a junior at CNU (link)! 

I was very interested in this course because as a communications major I understand the value of DH and I think it is important to grasp the subject because it is becoming the new “it” thing. I hope that by being in this class I learn a lot as well as how to become a better writer. I’d like to think of myself as a good writer but there’s always room for improvement! 

My goal after college is to work for a larger consulting firm and eventually stay and make a career out of that. Eventually I will need to go to grad school to get my MBA, so hopefully after getting a few years of experience, that company will help me pay for my schooling. The goal at the end of the day is to become a business executive, probably in the management consulting field. 

My life at CNU is pretty simple. I value service a lot and I make it a big priority of mine. In order to fulfill that, I am the officer of volunteer coordination for CNU’s Habitat for Humanity club(Link). Since I’ve worked with Habitat for Humanity since I was in high school, I knew this was something I wanted to continue to be involved in when I got to CNU as well and it worked out better than I could have imagined! 

I am also a sister of Alpha Phi (Link) and I have been able to make so many friends and connections. Greek life has allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and branch out to do new things and meet new people. It has also allowed me to get more involved on and off campus and broaden my horizons in that aspect as well. 

This summer I worked as an intern for a firm called L Street Partners (link) where I did lots of work with clients. My main task was working on media management, specifically social media for the client as well as learning about new platforms and how they operate. 

I am excited to see what the future holds for me and I am eager to see where I will end up in five or ten years from now.
